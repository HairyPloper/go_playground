1. What is the difference between motorbike and motorcycle :> ? I am curious, for this application this is same entity
2. Data that we are passing in runtime is important to be cached, not specified for performance?
3. Regarding Bonus Scenario. Should we send just tax info or whole file with vehicle times so that we just get result from single request?
4. From what i can tell approach with generic vehicle and enum for tollfreefeevehicles would be better option if we would need to work with custom/generic data provided to the app. This is just a thought
